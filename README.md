## DATA DESCRIPTION AND SUMMARY

This project of mine is based on a global meta-analysis published in *Nature Communications*. It compiles trait data from plants and animals to examine how competition between native and nonnative species shapes trait distributions. Data processing involved trait standardization, effect size calculation, and mixed-effects modeling. Results show that competition reduces trait means and increases variation, with stronger impacts from nonnatives. The project demonstrates skills in large-scale data integration, ecological statistics, and reproducible analysis.


## PREPARATION FOR THE DATASET

The dataset was prepared following PRISMA guidelines through a comprehensive literature search and screening process. Over **15,000 records** were initially retrieved from Web of Science using targeted search terms.

After applying strict inclusion criteriaâ€”such as:
- presence of **control vs. competition** treatments,
- availability of **trait means, variance, and sample size**, and
- evidence of **individual-level trait expression**,

we retained **346 studies** and **3,779 observations**.

Data were extracted from:
- article texts and tables,
- figures using [PlotDigitizer](https://plotdigitizer.com/app), and
- raw supplementary files.

Trait data were classified into **morphological**, **life-history**, and **chemical/physiological** categories. Competitor types were labeled as **intraspecific** or **interspecific**, and species provenance as **native** or **nonnative**, verified via external sources when needed.

We also performed **bibliometric analysis** using the R package [`bibliometrix`](https://www.bibliometrix.org/) to identify study trends and refine categories.

Effect sizes were calculated using the R package [`metafor`](https://www.metafor-project.org/):
- **lnRR** (log response ratio) for trait means,
- **lnCVR** (log coefficient of variation ratio) for trait variation.

We used **multi-level mixed-effects models** with random and fixed effects to analyze trait shifts, and conducted:
- **publication bias checks** using funnel plots and Egger's regression, and
- **sensitivity analyses** for outliers, variances, and ecosystem types.

All data processing and modeling were implemented in **R** and compiled in a fully reproducible **R Markdown** workflow.
