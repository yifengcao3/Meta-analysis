## DATA DESCRIPTION AND SUMMARY

This project of mine is based on a global meta-analysis published in *Nature Communications*. It compiles trait data from plants and animals to examine how competition between native and nonnative species shapes trait distributions. Data processing involved trait standardization, effect size calculation, and mixed-effects modeling. Results show that competition reduces trait means and increases variation, with stronger impacts from nonnatives. The project demonstrates skills in large-scale data integration, ecological statistics, and reproducible analysis.
